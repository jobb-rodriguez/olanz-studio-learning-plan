# What is your role?
Guide the team to deliver quality outputs in a timely and healthy manner.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide aims to teach project management by getting work done while maintaining healthy relationships.

# Assign Point Persons
Here are the areas I identified in your project:
1. Research
2. Frontend
3. Backend
4. Progress Reports

> [!NOTE]
> Your goal as Project Manager to ensure that all areas are progressing.

# Meeting Frequency
Meet only once a week. Every member will share the following:

1. Kumustahan
2. Progress for the past week
3. Share anything that the team may help him/her/them on the tasks
4. Assign tasks for the week

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When members are assigning tasks, check if the team is behind, on time, or ahead in terms of timeline.

Then, the point persons will share additional inputs if needed.

> [!NOTE]
> Maximize the Kanban. Meet only as needed.

# Maximize the Kanban Method
1. Reduce meetings by setting tasks in the Kanban efficiently.
2. Comment in tasks. Feel free to mention your members as needed.
3. If the matter can be addressed via text, select that option.

   2. Based on your initial requirements and project size, SQL is enough. But if you plan to scale your project, I recommend NoSQL.

## Trunk-based Development
Trunk-based development takes a more continuous delivery approach to software development, and branches are short-lived and merged as frequently as possible. The branches are smaller because they often contain only part of a feature. These short-lived development branches make the process of merging easier because there is less time for divergence between the main trunk and the branch copies.

Thus, trunk-based development is a methodology for releasing new features and small changes quickly while helping to avoid lengthy bug fixes and "merge hell". It is a growing popular devops practice among agile development teams, and is often paired with feature flags or feature toggles to ensure that any new features can be rolled back quickly and easily if any bugs are discovered.
